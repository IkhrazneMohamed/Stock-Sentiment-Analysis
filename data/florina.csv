8053;8053;7112022; Even when Tesla is ONLY a car company, the fact that your flawed assumptions on legacy being able to secure as much batteries as tesla will crash your entire model. This has already been probing out for legacy. This is why you keep seeing delays after delays in legacy.;0
8054;8054;7112022; My favorite is that some financial experts looked at the penalty for withdrawing the deal being a 1 billion dollar penalty meanwhile Musk liquidated 8.5 billion from Tesla right as Tesla becomes ineligible for certain government subsidies;0

8060;8060;7112022; Another huge fundamental flow is your assumption that legacy can acquire or be as good as Tesla when it comes to the limiting factor, batteries. In fact, the very idea that you think VW will overtake Tesla in 2 years shows how ridiculous that is.;1

8075;8075;7112022; absolutely beautiful demonstration of how Tesla's wireless power transmission worked. you know this is a genuine attempt and not fraud because you can't see the coil arcing *at all* except accidentally at one point;0
8076;8076;7112022; Nikola Tesla loved a bird “Yes, I loved that pigeon, I loved her as a man loves a woman, and she loved me.” Elon has an on again off again relationship with Twitter ;0
