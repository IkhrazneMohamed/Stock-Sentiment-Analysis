1606;7/11/2022; Yeah the older people will die first.;
1607;7/11/2022; Then how come we see so many reports of Tesla owners waiting in very long lines to charge? Many of us may usually charge at home but what if we are on a long trip? And as more less expensive EVs are available the charging dynamic will likely shift to more public.;
1608;7/11/2022; no ... Tesla was shut down for much of the quarter due to covid ....;
1609;7/11/2022; So are present fathers;
1610;7/11/2022; And EA absolutely has incentive to continue to improve and grow. Because of their relationship with VW, who has an aggressive EV road map, and their relationships with other manufacturers that are rolling out their own EVs. The narrative that they don’t have incentive is hogwash.;

1632;7/11/2022; First of all, I don’t care why they’re doing it, as long as it’s getting done. Secondly, that might have been their origins, but it’s not their model moving forward. I work with EA and they have a great group of people that are focused on improving and growing the network.;
1633;7/11/2022; haha sure, starting, lets go:;
1634;7/11/2022; It seems to be part of their operating model to keep at least 1 charger out of order at any time. I have seen that so many times. That's a problem, especially when compared to Tesla expanding its network at ludicrous speed with higher uptime and reliability.;

1637;7/11/2022; Solar is expensive, esp if you want battery backups. Been looking in to this for personal use. If you have an e-car, need 2 Tesla Powerwalls for efficient charging. With the federal tax credit, it’s about $50-55k. The 26% credit sunsets this year down to 22%, unless expanded. $$;

1656;7/11/2022; Because hybrid means you have to maintain two powertrains instead of one. Second in the case the mentioned above they are at a store, or maybe at work so waiting for it to charge isnt an issue. But they may not be able, or rather not have to move it to and from a charging station;
1657;7/11/2022; They are all garbage on the inside. Extremely cheap. Ford is the absolute worst and then Chevy. It was just disappointing that the teslas are engineered to the highest possibility and then the cup holder covers are held in place with plastic tabs that break almost immediately.;

7409;7/11/2022; weird how those drunk donkeys in a tent, beat the germans on every metric that sports cars track. And even most metrics they dont track. Past performance does not equal future results;
7410;7/11/2022; Ummm... No, he threw his PayPal money at a roadster frame licensed from Lotus. Then he convinced enough investors into funding Tesla. Then he got investors into his space stuff. All he did was throw other people's money at projects. #ElonMusk #elongatedmuskrat #ElonMuskTwitter ;
7411;7/11/2022; i thought it was a tesla;
7412;7/11/2022; Do you have the data separated out geographically? Or just global totals? Do you have an excel you can share?;
7413;7/11/2022; And may I say Elon works really hard to the point he sleep on Tesla factory floor.;
7414;7/11/2022; It will go that way as long as Tesla has more demand than it can supply. As soon as that changes, superchargers will go back to Tesla-only. All news outlets will report and bitch about it. Which is free advertisement and will increase demand insanely for Tesla.;
7415;7/11/2022;" I would love to see Tesla continue to propel above &amp; beyond all competition that’s inevitably planning on taking the lead, but, w/all due respect, the designs are a tad stale. I’m offering to create far superior designs for Tesla. DM me to discuss this opportunity further. 🍻";
7416;7/11/2022; First of all he hasn’t lost anything. Twitter will never get that billion. Second, Tesla stock is higher than it was a year ago and is up $17.46 in the last 24hr. It’s always been a volatile stock and most stocks aren’t doing that great right now.;
7417;7/11/2022; is backing out of the twitter deal because he can't afford the deal. His valuation as the world's richest person comes after the fact that tesla is an overvalued stock. With a recession and competition in EV segment, buying twitter would be the worst investment decision;

7421;7/11/2022; It is the matchup of the now. And also not the point. and I both had fun. We both won prizes for different categories this weekend. We didn’t seek out a venue to pit one car against another. We showed what each is currently capable of and had fun doing it.;
7422;7/11/2022; Busses are much less convenient than Ubers. Robo taxi would retain the convenience of an Uber, but price would drop down from two dollars/mile to 20 cents/mile. Never mind the privacy and security.;
7423;7/11/2022; Minimum, add the Tesla experience you get and hands down winner;
7424;7/11/2022; Elon Musk’s Twitter flip-flop cues up a strange legal fight. In trying to terminate his $44 billion takeover deal, Tesla boss sets stage for what could become one of the oddest courtroom battles in corporate-takeover history ;
7425;7/11/2022; 🇳🇦😳Bombiggy, get well soon my friend 🇳🇦;
7426;7/11/2022; I dont mind some cars being faster than Tesla if they are sagnificantly more expensive. That makes perfect sense. It always just makes me realise how insanely Good Teslas are for their price;

7438;7/11/2022; She popped a tesla now she gon electric;
7439;7/11/2022; Do the robo-taxi sales result in a drop in Tesla sales, or in competitors sales? If the robotaxi TAM is 20m cars, and Tesla is the only one supplying, their sales won’t fall by 90%, as they will still sell the 20m cars. They will also turnover quicker, as they rack up big miles.;
7440;7/11/2022; Of course it's S3XY, it's a Tesla 😉;
7441;7/11/2022; I made a graph showing global Supercharger Station growth since 2012. There are now about ~4,000 stations with 35k+ charging connectors. Note: Only Q1 data is available so far for 2022, but it's clear that is deploying charging stations at a record rate. ;

7460;7/11/2022; I am bored by speed being a standard for anything. Get a proper customer service, proper build quality, proper repair shops, keep your promises with your customers, keep your timelines.... Lucid is the clear winner here. Tesla is third. Diversity has won.;
7461;7/11/2022; It should be tri-motor against tri-motor. This is not the matchup of the century.;

7473;7/11/2022; I simply despise automakers attempts at software. They either over complicate things making the drivers experience miserable, or the software felt half assed like they did it in a hurry with no further thought. Some just look like a 2002 mp3 players OS.;

7476;7/11/2022; I don’t think Tesla is having any problems selling their cars. If you order a model S right now you’re looking at at least a year to get delivery. All of these other models have huge backlogs as well. They can’t produce them fast enough.;

7485;7/11/2022; The USA, comparative to China, is far behind on the new vehicle sales front for Q1. All automakers, even Tesla, are struggling with the ongoing semiconductor shortages, and they started the month of June with desperately low inventories on dealer lots and in transit. (3/3) ;
7486;7/11/2022; Tesla did prove EVs were viable, but they’re no longer the leader in them. Tesla is a car built by a tech company, not an EV built by a car company. Their build can often be pretty shitty and trad’l car companies have caught up. Not worth the price, even outside of Elon as Elon;

8582;7/11/2022;" Yeah, the oil lobbies are causing the lithium battery &amp; nickel to go up as well somehow. I'm sure day to day check to check workers with mini vans or trucks can do their day to day with a Tesla. Good job genius.";
8583;7/11/2022; Reviled by the Tesla customer base and being called a “bus hit artist” by your oranges daddy, you must be feeling unloved by anyone. Expect to lose the lawsuits and pay billions for your impulse buy of Twitter.;

8593;7/11/2022; Dear Tesla YouTubers, your perspective on other EVs is no more truth than my perspective on other EVs. Now to watch another predictable train wreck, hoping the whole time is not a predictable train wreck.;
8594;7/11/2022; Yes, it is luck. Also, Tesla is not actually profitable without reams of accounting tricks. It's likely it's only source of profits (China) will not allow any repatriation of the cash.;
