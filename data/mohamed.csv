Second in the case the mentioned above they are at a store, or maybe at work so waiting for it to charge isnt an issue. But they may not be able, or rather not have to move it to and from a charging station;
1657;1657;7/11/2022; They are all garbage on the inside. Extremely cheap. Ford is the absolute worst and then Chevy. It was just disappointing that the teslas are engineered to the highest possibility and then the cup holder covers are held in place with plastic tabs that break almost immediately.;
